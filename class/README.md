This file contains the notebooks used.
They can be viewed by the numbered order.

The only things that are un-numbered are the `test` directory and the `py23.py`, `my_func.py` and `test_my_func.py`.
These files are used to show an exmaple of `pytest`.

To run `pytest` you type `pytest` in the command prompt.
It will look for all folders named `test`, and files that begin or end with `test`, and run all functions that begin or end with `test`.
Remember you run `pytest` from the command line, not from a notebook or within Python.
